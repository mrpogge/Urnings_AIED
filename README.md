# Warming up the Cold Start Problem: Adaptive Step Size Methods for the Urnings Algorithm

## Code base

The code base contains the necessarry classes for performing simulation with different versions of the Urnings algorithm. These are Urnings 1 (Bolsinova et al 2021) with adaptive and nonadaptive item selection. Currently the adaptivity is based on Hofmann et al (2021, normal quantiles method).
The analysis presented in the article can be found in the sim_fix.ipynb and sim_change.ipynb notebooks.
