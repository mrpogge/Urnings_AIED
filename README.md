# Warming up the Cold Start Problem: Adaptive Step Size Methods for the Urnings Algorithm

## Code base

The code base contains the necessarry classes for performing simulation with different versions of the Urnings algorithm. These are Urnings 1 (Bolsinova et al 2021) with adaptive and nonadaptive item selection. Currently the adaptivity is based on Hofmann et al (2021, normal quantiles method).
The analysis presented in the article can be found in the sim_fix.ipynb and sim_change.ipynb notebooks.

## Supplementary material

A summary of the simulation study and the used terminology, a more detailed description of the urnings algorithm and the pseudo-code for the adaptive step size modification can be found in the file "suplementary_material.pdf".
